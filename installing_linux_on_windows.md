# Installing Linux on Windows

Most web developer work exclusively in a linux like environment (don't worry mac users, macOS is very similar to linux under the covers).  If you have a Windows machine and want to do web development, the easiest way to get started is to install linux on your computer.  We will do the install using a virtual machine called [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and a linux distribution called [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/).


1. Download and install [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
2. Download [Ubuntu Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop), but do not try to install it.  Just take note of where you downloaded the .iso file.
3. Open up virutal box and click the new button.  
4. Name the virtual machine anything you like (maybe Ubuntu).  Make sure the type is linux and the version is Ubuntu 64-bit.
5. Click continue/create for the next couple of screens.  You do not need to change any of the default settings
6. Click on your newly create vm in virtual box and click start
7. Now you need to find the ubuntu .iso file that you downloaded earlier.  Find it in your file system, select it, and then click continue
8. Install ubuntu!
